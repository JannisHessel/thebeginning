			The Reservoir <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bavarian_Forest" target="new" title="Wikipedia">Bavarian Forest</a>  is the oldest nature reservoir in Germany.
			In its heart,at the czech border, there is a special mountain raising his bald head above the surrounding.
			On the path to the Top of this unique mountain we will encounter a lot of the recent Nature history of the Area and some older phenomena.
			<p>Hint:in the bottom left corner you can hide all elements to look at the background!</p>

			The about 10 km long tour will take us along a river that was used for wood drafting to the reservoir at the top of it, which is now a mountain lake biotope.
			Past that we will go along the steep hillside towards the Teufelsloch, a rocky canyon in the side of the mountain.
			Shortly before the raise to the summit there is an elevated plane which did undergo quite a big vegetation change recently.
			The raise to the summit is called Himmelsleiter- a staircase consisting of the nature rocks.
			The summit is a Giant sea of rocks that gives the Mountain its unique look and makes for a great unblocked view of everything around.
