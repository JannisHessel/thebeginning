            This river originates in a lake called Martinsklause. The way is going to walk alongside and upstream until we reach the lake, which is another stop in the journey.
            Alongside the river you will find a lot of small wells, especially when it has rained recently, that run over the path into the river. This can make the parth quit a bit muddy and you will have to step around it every once in a while. This (and the moss that is growing ) also makes for the wet-woody smell this part of the forrest has.

            You rarely see any animals around, just occasionally you can spot a frog a bird or a fish around and in the river. Usually animals hide from the human intruders. More often you can hear a frog croak or a bird sing or frantically sound the intruder alarm. Often you can see holes in the floor on the sides of the way where wild boars dug for edible roots. Also if you find a puddle that stayed for a bit longer while it is gonna be full of little crab-like cratures.

            The vegetation around the river is dominatet by ferns and mosses. The trees are still a mix between needle and leaf tree.<br>

                <p>Mosses are small flowerless plants that typically grow in dense green clumps or mats, often in damp or shady locations. The individual plants are usually composed of simple leaves that are generally only one cell thick, attached to a stem that may be branched or unbranched and has only a limited role in conducting water and nutrients.</p>

                <p>The moss Phycomitrella patens has been used as a model organism to study how plants repair damage to their DNA, especially the repair mechanism known as homologous recombination. If the plant cannot repair DNA damage, e.g. double-strand breaks, in their somatic cells, the cells can lose normal functions or die.</p>

                <p>A lot of the moss spiecies survive on rather hard conditions for other plant like shady places, acidic floors or on rocks and treetrungs with very little acess to fertile soil. Some species can even dry out completely and come back to life once water is present.</p>

                <p>There is a substantial market in mosses gathered from the wild. The uses for intact moss are principally in the florist trade and for home decoration. Decaying moss in the genus Sphagnum is also the major component of peat, which is "mined" for use as a fuel, as a horticultural soil additive, and in smoking malt in the production of Scotch whisky.</p>

                <p>The stereotypical image of ferns growing in moist shady woodland nooks is far from a complete picture of the habitats where ferns can be found growing. Fern species live in a wide variety of habitats, from remote mountain elevations, to dry desert rock faces, to bodies of water or in open fields. Ferns in general may be thought of as largely being specialists in marginal habitats, often succeeding in places where various environmental factors limit the success of flowering plants.</p>

                <p>Ferns first appear in the fossil record about 360 million years ago in the late Devonian period, but many of the current families and species did not appear until roughly 145 million years ago in the early Cretaceous, after flowering plants came to dominate many environments. The fern Osmunda claytoniana is a paramount example of evolutionary stasis; paleontological evidence indicates it has remained unchanged, even at the level of fossilized nuclei and chromosomes, for at least 180 million years.</p>

                <p>The tree ferns are the ferns that grow with a trunk elevating the fronds above ground level. Tree ferns are found growing in tropical and subtropical areas, including cool to temperate rainforests in Australia, New Zealand and neighbouring regions (e.g. Malaysia, Lord Howe Island, etc.). Like all ferns, tree ferns reproduce by means of spores formed on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
